# Overview

## Introduction

Both the client and server versions of Windows implement standard authentication protocols including:

* [Kerberos](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_d6a282ce-b1da-41e1-b05a-22f777a5c1fe),
* [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_f2bc7fed-7e02-4fa5-91b3-97f5c978563a), and
* Simple and Protected _Generic Security Service Application Program Interface_ ([GSS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_95f6b299-ec2f-4cef-87df-217f95bd9e14)-API) Negotiation Mechanism ([SPNEGO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_bc2f6b5e-e5c0-408b-8f55-0350c24b9838)),
* and their extensions, as specified in [\[MS-KILE\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-kile/2a32282e-dd48-4ad9-a542-609804b02cc9), [\[MS-TLSP\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-tlsp/58aba05b-62b0-4cd1-b88b-dc8a24920346), [\[MS-SPNG\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-spng/f377a379-c24f-4a0f-a3eb-0d835389e28a), and [\[MS-NEGOEX\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-negoex/0ad7a003-ab56-4839-a204-b555ca6759a2) respectively.

_as part of an extensible architecture that consists of security support provider (SSP) security packages._

## Security Principal

An entity with an identity that can be authenticated.

### Types

A security principal can be

* a user
* an autonomous program within the system, such as a logging daemon, a system backup program, or a network application.
* a computer, a service, or a security group that represents a set of users

### Security Identifier (SID)

Windows uses a [security identifier (SID)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_83f2020d-0804-4840-a5ac-e06439d50f8d), composed of

* an account authority portion (typically a [domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_b0276eb2-4e65-4cf1-a718-e0920a614aca)) and
* a smaller integer representing an identity relative to the account authority termed the relative identifier (RID)

as an identity of a security principal.

## Generic Security Services (GSS)

GSS API decoupled application protocols from authentication protocols by providing an abstraction layer between application-level protocols and _security protocols_.

The Windows implementation, SSPI, thus also allows an application to use various security models available on a computer or network without changing the interface to the security system.

> SSPI is the Windows equivalent of GSS-API, and the two sets of APIs are on-the-wire \
> compatible; hence the terms GSS-API and SSPI are used interchangeably.

### Security Token

In the GSS style or model, the authentication protocol produces opaque messages that are known as [security tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_6b49ccf2-3d93-4d1e-9ecd-e5e7873eec24). The application protocol is responsible for security token exchange between sender and receiver _but does not parse or interpret the security tokens._

For example, Kerberos tickets.

### Authentication Service

The Authentication Services protocols provide authentication services to client and server applications.

Client and server applications interact with

* the [Authentication Client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_e67f665e-7970-422b-b471-cb33147c0641) and
* [Authentication Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_3ca15667-25b2-495d-a86f-2f37135f7b05)

_components of Authentication Services respectively_.

### Authentication Process

1. <mark style="color:green;">The client application</mark> contacts the local Authentication Client through a generic interface that abstracts the underlying authentication protocols for creating a security token.
2. The Authentication Client creates a security token with the help of the underlying authentication protocols and returns it to the calling <mark style="color:green;">application</mark>.
3. <mark style="color:green;">The client application</mark> embeds the security token within application messages of the application protocol and transmits them as an authentication request to <mark style="color:red;">the server side of the application</mark>.
4. On receipt of the authentication messages, <mark style="color:red;">the server application</mark> extracts the security token and supplies it to the Authentication Server.
5. The Authentication Server processes the security token with the help of the underlying authentication protocols and generates a response _determining whether that authentication is complete for_ the <mark style="color:red;">server-side application</mark>.
6. If another security token is generated, <mark style="color:red;">the server-side application</mark> sends it back to <mark style="color:green;">the client</mark>, where the process continues.

When authentication is complete, session-specific security services are available.

### Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO)

When Microsoft adopted the Kerberos protocol for Windows and moved away from [NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Protocol](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_fff710f9-e3d1-4991-99a2-009768d57585), Microsoft chose to insert a protocol, in this case, SPNEGO, to allow _security protocol selection and extension_.

SPNEGO is an authentication _mechanism_ that allows [Generic Security Services (GSS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_95f6b299-ec2f-4cef-87df-217f95bd9e14) peers to determine whether their credentials support a common set of GSS-API security mechanisms

* to negotiate different options within a given security mechanism or different options from several security mechanisms
* to select a service, and
* to establish a [security context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_88d49f20-6c95-4b64-a52c-c3eca2fe5709) among themselves using that service.

## Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)

The [Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_fb216516-748b-4873-8bdd-64c5f4da9920) is the Windows-specific API _implementation of the GSS-style authentication model_.

SSPI is implemented as DLLs containing SSPs for different types of authentication protocols.

SSPI provides the means for connected network applications to call _one of several_ [_security support providers (SSPs)_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-authsod/64781df1-ee20-413e-b8c5-6511c90dbc30#gt\_e0edad22-1b0e-42f3-8e51-50f8aa30b29a), associated with different authentication protocols, to establish authenticated connections and to exchange data securely over those connections.

### Security Support Package (SSP)

Each SSP provides mappings between the SSPI function calls of an application and the functions of an actual security model.

## Windows Negotiate

A security support provider (SSP) acts as an application layer between Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) _and the other SSPs_.

Negotiate analyzes the request and picks the best SSP to handle the request _based on customer-configured security policy._

### Kerberos & NTLM

Currently, the Negotiate security package selects between [Kerberos](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-kerberos) and [NTLM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm). Negotiate selects Kerberos unless one of the following conditions applies:

* It can't be used by one of the systems involved in the authentication.
* The calling app didn't provide sufficient information to use Kerberos.

To allow Negotiate to select the [Kerberos](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-kerberos) security provider, the client app must provide one of the following:

* A [_service principal name_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secgloss/s-gly) (SPN).
* A user principal name (UPN).
* A NetBIOS account name as the target name.

Otherwise, Negotiate always selects the [NTLM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-ntlm) security provider.
