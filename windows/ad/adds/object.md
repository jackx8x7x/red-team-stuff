# AD Objects
## Security Principal
A security principal object has the `objectSid` attribute.

In Active Directory,
- the user
- computer and
- group object classes
are examples of security principal object classes though not every group object is a security principal object.

In AD LDS, an independent mode of Active Directory, any object containing the *msDS-BindableObject auxiliary class* is a security principal.

## Access Control
Access control is administered at the object level by setting different levels of access, or permissions, to objects, such as Full Control, Write, Read, or No Access.
