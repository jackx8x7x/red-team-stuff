# Overview
## Introduction
Red team simulate a real adversary to test *blue team*'s capabilities at detecting and responding.

### Compare To Pentest
Red team put effort, unlike pentests, into keeping undetected and evading security mechanisms like
- firewall
- antivirus
- EDR
- IPS

The object is to find a path to the goal of the engagement, not to assess vulnerabilities across all the host.

## Blue Team
Usually, the blue team won't be informed of the exercise.

Red team simulate real TTPs to help blue team to improve their detection and responding capabilities 

## Framework
Frameworks can be used as a common language among parties among a red team engagement.
